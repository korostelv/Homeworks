	<h1>Romeo and Juliet</h1>

	<p class="color">ACT 1</p>

	<p class="color">PROLOGUE</p>

	<p>Two households, both alike in dignity,<br>
	In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,<br>
	From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,<br>
	Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.<br>
		From forth the fatal loins of these two foes<br>
	A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;<br>
	Whose misadventur'd piteous overthrows<br>
	Doth with their death bury their parents' strife.<br>
	The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,<br>
	And the continuance of their parents' rage,<br>
	Which, but their children's end, naught could remove,<br>
	Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;<br>
	The which if you with patient ears attend,<br>
	What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.</p>

	<p class="color">SCENE I.Verona. A public place.</p>
 
	<p>Enter SAMSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, with swords and bucklers.</p>
 
	<p class="color">SAMPSON</p>

	<p>Gregory, on my word, we'll not carry coals.</p>

	<p class="color">GREGORY</p>

	<p> No, for then we should be colliers</p>
