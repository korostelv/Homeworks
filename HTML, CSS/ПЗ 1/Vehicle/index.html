	<h1>Vehicle</h1>

	<p>
	A vehicle (from Latin: vehiculum<sup><a href=#1>[1]</a></sup>) is a machine that transports people or cargo. Vehicles include wagons, bicycles, motor vehicles (motorcycles, cars, trucks, buses), railed vehicles (trains, trams), watercraft (ships, boats), amphibious vehicles (screw-propelled vehicle, hovercraft), aircraft (airplanes, helicopters) and spacecraft.<sup><a href=#2>[2]</a></sup>
	</p>

	<p>
	Land vehicles are classified broadly by what is used to apply steering and drive forces against the ground: wheeled, tracked, railed or skied. ISO 3833-1977 is the standard, also internationally used in legislation, for road vehicles types, terms and definitions.<sup><a href=#3>[3]</a></sup>
